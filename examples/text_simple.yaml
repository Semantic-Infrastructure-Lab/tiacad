# Simple Text Example - Basic 3D Text
#
# Demonstrates creating basic 3D text using TiaCAD's text sketch shape.
# The text is defined in a sketch and then extruded into 3D geometry.
#
# Usage:
#   tiacad build examples/text_simple.yaml

# Note: Dummy part required by schema (sketch-only not yet supported)
