# Text Primitive vs Sketch Comparison
#
# This example demonstrates both approaches to creating 3D text in TiaCAD.
#
# APPROACH 1: Text as Primitive (NEW in Phase 2!)
# - Simpler syntax - just define text as a primitive part
# - Quick 3D text creation without sketch ceremony
# - Consistent with other primitives (box, cylinder, etc.)
# - Best for: Standalone text, labels, signs
#
# APPROACH 2: Text in Sketch (from Phase 1)
# - More flexible - can position text within a sketch
# - Can set text position explicitly
# - Best for: Positioned text on sketch planes
#
# Usage:
#   python -m tiacad_core examples/text_primitive_vs_sketch.yaml

# APPROACH 1: Text as Primitive (Phase 2)
parts:
  primitive_example:
    primitive: text
    text: "PRIMITIVE"
    size: 15
    height: 3
    halign: center
    valign: center
    font: "Liberation Sans"
    style: bold
    color: blue

# APPROACH 2: Text in Sketch (Phase 1)
sketches:
  sketch_example:
    plane: XY
    origin: [0, -25, 0]  # Position below primitive example
    shapes:
      - type: text
        text: "SKETCH"
        size: 15
        halign: center
        valign: center
        operation: add

operations:
  sketch_extruded:
    type: extrude
    sketch: sketch_example
    distance: 3
