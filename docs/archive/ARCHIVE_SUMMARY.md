## Why Archive These?

These documents served critical roles during development:
- **Planning:** Guided architectural decisions and feature development
- **Tracking:** Monitored progress through complex multi-phase work
- **Analysis:** Deep dives into limitations and improvement opportunities
- **Communication:** Shared vision and status across sessions

They're archived because:
- ✅ **Plans executed** - Work is complete
- 📚 **Historical value** - Document decision-making process
- 📖 **Current docs updated** - Key information moved to active documentation
- 🔄 **Prevent confusion** - Clear what's current vs historical
