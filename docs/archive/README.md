## 🔍 Why Archive These?

These documents were valuable during development but:
- Contain outdated status information
- Are superseded by current documentation
- Are primarily of historical interest
- Would clutter main documentation

They're preserved for:
- Understanding past decisions
- Historical context for features
- Tracking evolution of the project
